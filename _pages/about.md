I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Decisions, Operations and Technology at Chinese University of Hong Kong, collaborating with Prof. Xiting Gong.
I received a PhD degree in Operations Research from Tsinghua University and a BS degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

My research interests lie broadly in data-driven learning and optimization, and asymptotic analysis, with a particular emphasis on the application of these methods in the field of inventory and revenue management.
