My research interests lie broadly in online learning and optimization, and asymptotic analysis, with a particular emphasis on the application of these methods in the field of inventory and revenue management.

Low-dimensional Heuristics Design for Operations Management
--------
<details open>
  <summary> Research Context & Motivation: </summary>
  Many supply chain and revenue management problems have increasingly complicated features, e.g., positive lead times, multi-echelon, multi-products, and fluctuated demand environment. Therefore, the optimal policies for these problems usually have a complex structure, which may make the policies hard to implement and result in customersâ€™ strategic behavior. When the dimensions of these features are large, the optimal policies are even computationally intractable due to the notorious curse of dimensionality. In this direction, we investigate how to design low-dimensional heuristics that are decided by a few parameters, such as base-stock, $(s,S)$, and static pricing policies. We want the new heuristic to be both easy to implement in practice and have a good theoretical guarantee.
